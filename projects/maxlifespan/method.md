## Epigenetic predictors of maximum lifespan and other life history traits in mammals

**Method**

We analyzed methylation data from 192 mammalian species representing 21 different phylogenetic orders (Extended Data Table 1.1, Fig. 1). DNA was derived from 64 different tissues and organs including blood, skin, liver, muscle, and several brain regions (Extended Data Table 1.2). Materials and Additional File 1 contains details on all the data sets that we have used to conduct analyses. To enhance the reproducibility of our findings we include our updated version of the anAge database.
