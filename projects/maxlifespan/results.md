**Results**

We employed penalized regression analysis to determine the potential relationship between DNA methylation and species lifespan, gestation time, and age at sexual maturity. These life history traits were taken from the current version of the anAge database (Methods) 2. The resulting epigenetic predictors exhibited a high level of accuracy according to leave-one-species-out (LOSO) cross validation. The correlation between predicted and actual log maximum lifespan was r=0.89 (Fig. 1a & 1b). The log gestation time predictor had an even higher correlation of r=0.96 (Fig. 1c) and the log age at sexual maturity predictor exhibited a correlation of r=0.87 (Fig. 1d), respectively. We refer to the predicted maximum lifespan, in units of years, as epigenetic maximum lifespan or DNA methylation maximum lifespan, reflecting its provenance.
