**Abstract**

Maximum lifespan of a species is the oldest that individuals can survive, reflecting the genetic limit of longevity in an ideal environment. Here we report methylation-based models that accurately predict maximum lifespan (r=0.89), gestational time (r=0.96), and age at sexual maturity (r=0.87), using cytosine methylation patterns collected from over 12,000 samples derived from 192 mammalian species. Our epigenetic maximum lifespan predictor corroborated the extended lifespan in growth hormone receptor knockout mice, rapamycin treated mice. Across dog breeds, epigenetic maximum lifespan correlates positively with breed lifespan but negatively with breed size. Lifespan-related cytosines are located in transcriptional regulatory regions, such as bivalent chromatin promoters and polycomb-repressed regions, which were hypomethylated in long-lived species. The epigenetic estimators of maximum lifespan and other life history traits will be useful for characterizing understudied species and for identifying interventions that extend lifespan.
