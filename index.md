## Welcome!

I am a Professor in [Human Genetics](https://medschool.ucla.edu/human-genetics) and Biostatistics at [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu). My methodological research area lies at the intersection of biostatistics, bioinformatics, computational biology, cancer research, genetics, epidemiology, machine learning, and systems biology. My group applies these methods to study a broad spectrum of diseases, e.g. aging research, cancer, cardiovascular disease, HIV, Huntington’s disease, neurodegenerative diseases.

### Projects

**Systems biology and systems genetics**: My group develops and applies methods for analyzing and integrating gene expression-, DNA methylation-, microRNA, genetic marker-, and complex phenotype data. In particular, we developed weighted correlation network analysis (also known as weighted gene co-expression network analysis WGCNA), which is a systems biologic data analysis method for analyzing high dimensional “-omics” data. These methods also lend themselves for comparing different species at the genomic level. A lot of material including articles, R software tutorials, and youtube lectures can be found [here](https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/CoexpressionNetwork/).
